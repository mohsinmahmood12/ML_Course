"""
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that involves training agents to make decisions in an environment by learning from the consequences of their actions. 
It is based on the concept of reward-based learning, where an agent learns to maximize a cumulative reward signal by taking actions in an environment. 
RL has been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, including game playing, robotics, and decision-making systems. 
It is a popular area of research in artificial intelligence, and has been used to solve problems such as playing chess and Go, controlling robots, and optimizing energy consumption in buildings.

The output of this program will not be visible in the form of any print statements or visual output. 
This program is using the openai gym environment, which provides a way to interact with a simulation or game, but it does not provide any visual display of the game. 
Instead, it returns the state, reward, and done flag after each action taken. So you can use these outputs to train your agent to take better actions.

Also this is a random agent so it will not learn from the environment, rather it will act randomly and will not be able to balance the pole for long. 
This example is just to show how to interact with openai gym environment.
