# Machine Learning Semester Course
This repository contains all the codes and materials for the Machine Learning Semester Course offered at CUST University. The course covers various topics in Machine Learning, including:

[1] Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
[2] Linear Regression
[3] Logistic Regression
[4] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
[5] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
[6] K-Means Clustering
[7] Neural Networks
[8] Decision Trees
[9] Naive Bayes

## Getting Started
To get started with the code, you will need to have a programming environment set up on your machine. This includes a text editor or IDE, and a version of Python (preferably the latest version) installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Usage
Each topic has its own folder in the repository, where you will find the code and any additional materials (e.g. datasets) related to that topic. To run the code, simply open it in your text editor or IDE, and run it using your Python environment.

## Contributing
If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We welcome any contributions to help make this repository a valuable resource for students of Machine Learning.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the support and guidance of the faculty and staff of CUST University for making this course possible.
